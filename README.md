# onelog

Batteries-included logging for Clojure.

Be aware that this is alpha code. It may have bugs, and the API may
change before the final release. Pull requests are welcome!

## Usage

Require `onelog.core`. Call `(set-default-logger!)` with an optional
logfile name. Then call `(info "whatever")`, `(warn "foo")`, etc. 

More docs to come.
